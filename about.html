    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Since 2016, StuyPrep has worked with traditionally underrepresented middle school students to gain admission into NYC's specialized high schools. We have remained a quality form of supplementary education for students who may not have the financial resources to pay for SHSAT prep classes, which can be $1000+. The program promotes equity in the public education system, bridging the gap between students of different socio-economic and racial backgrounds. There is power in accessibility: the choice to attend whatever school a child dreams of, furthering their education and continued access to educational resources.
    </p>
    <p>StuyPrep is led by a group of brilliant Stuyvesant High School students motivated to continue our legacy of democratizing education, and we always look to welcome new students and tutors on our journey.</p>
