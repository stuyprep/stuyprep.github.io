      <h2>Introducing...</h2>
      <h2>Our Free SHSAT Prep Program!</h2>
      <p>Our 6-week SHSAT Prep program runs twice a year, at absolutely no cost to the student. All you need is a laptop with Internet access.
        Now in our 7th year of operation, the program is led and run by students from Stuyvesant High School with extensive experience in tutoring.
      </p>
      <h4>Program Details</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fall 2022 session: Sundays from October 9th - November 13th.</li>

      </ul>
      <h4>Class Structure and Content</h4>
      <p>We will cover all topics in ELA and Math needed in preparation for the SHSAT. The program could also serve as enrichment
